# SSCBench-KITTI-360
## Change Log
* 2024/09: SSCBench-KITTI-360 is now available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai4ce/SSCBench/tree/main/sscbench-kitti)
* 2023/06: Initial release.

## Overview
KITTI-360 covers a driving distance of 73.7km, comprising 300K images and 80K laser scans. Leveraging the open-source training and validation set, we build SSCBench-KITTI-360 consisting of 9 long sequences. To reduce redundancy, we sample every 5 frames following the SemanticKITTI SSC benchmark. The training set includes 8,487 frames from scenes 00, 02-05, 07, and 10, while the validation set comprises 1,812 frames from scene 06. The testing set comprises 2,566 frames from scene 09. In total, the dataset contains 12,865 frames

```

For each frame in the dataset, we provide the following information:
* `image_00`: RGB image of size 376x1408.
* `voxels`: Voxelized point cloud of size 256x256x32. Each voxel is a 0.2x0.2x0.2 meter cube.
    * `*.bin`: voxelized point cloud in binary format 
    * `*.label`: voxelized point cloud label in binary format
    * `*.invalid` = voxelized point cloud invalid mask in binary format.

For MonoScene and VoxFormer, a preprocessed downsampled version of the dataset is provided in the `preprocess` folder. We provide two scales of downsampled point clouds: 1/1 and 1/8. The downsampled point clouds are stored in the `labels` folder, stored as `.npy` files.

## Data Download
The dataset can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai4ce/SSCBench/tree/main/sscbench-kitti). The dataset is provided in the form of squashed file system for easy use for singularity containers. Use the following command to merge the split parts of the datasets.
```
cat split_parts_* > combined.sqfs
```
* If you want to use the dataset on a singularity container, you can mount each squashed file system to the container using the `--overlay` option.
* If you want to use the dataset on a normal system, you can unsquash the file system using the `unsquashfs` command (more details [here](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/unsquashfs.1.html)). Then, please organize the data as the folder structure described above.
